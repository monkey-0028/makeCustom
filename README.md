### Example
> If you are using git then you know that we have to enter `git status` again and again to check status of git-repo in your locals.
> It is not a very long command but still it becomes annoying to type, over time.
> Here is the solution!!
> use **makeCustom** to rename this code to anything you want.. let's say `g`
> Now -- **`git status` is equivalent to `g`**
> and sub-commands like `git status -s` or `git staus -v` works fine like `g -s` or `g -v`.
